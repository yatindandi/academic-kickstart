__"The  only real limitations on making ‘machines which think’ are our own limitations in not knowing exactly what ‘thinking’ consists of."__

I am a sophomore at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. My goal is to understand the computational building blocks of intelligence and consciousness through probabilistic modelling techniques applied to machine learning systems as well as the human mind. To this end, I have been working with the state of the art approaches to building intelligent systems such as Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

Of late, I have been deeply fascinated by the ability of deep generative models to learn complex representations. Most of my recent work has focused on using generative models for learning disentangled representations of sequential data. I spend most of my time reading various Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning research papers and implementing them. I have also worked in Computational Cognitive Science, specifically in understanding the principles behind the recognition and inference of emotions by humans. 

In future I also hope to explore Computational Neuroscience and Statistical Learning Theory.
